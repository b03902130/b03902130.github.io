            <br>There was an old lady of Chertsey.
            <br>Who made a remarkable curtsey;
            <br>She twirled round and round,
            <br>till she sank underground,
            <br>Which distressed all the people of Chertsey.

            <br>There was an Old Lady of Prague,
            <br>Whose language was horribly vague;
            <br>When they said, “Are these caps?”
            <br>she answered, “Perhaps!”
            <br>That oracular Lady of Prague.

            <br>There was an old Lady of Winchelsea,
            <br>Who said, “If you needle or pin shall see
            <br>On the floor of my room,
            <br>Sweep it up with the broom!”
            <br>That exhaustive old Lady of Winchelsea!

        <h2>There was an old man...</h2>

        <div class="col" id="col-7">
            <img src="./images/old man-1.png" alt="">
            <br>There was an Old Man with a nose,
            <br>Who said, “If you choose to suppose
            <br>My nose is too long, you are certainly wrong!”
            <br>That remarkable Man with a nose
            </div>

            <img src="./images/old man-2.png" alt="">
            <br>There was an old man on the Border,
            <br>Who lived in the utmost disorder;
            <br>Danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat,
            <br>Which vexed all the folks on the Border.
        </div>

            <img src="./images/old man-3.png" alt="">
            <br>There was an old man of Dunrose;
            <br>A parrot seized hold of his nose.
            <br>When he grew melancholy,
            <br>they said, “His name’s Polly.”
            <br>Which soothed that old man of Dunrose.

            <br>There was an Old Person shoes habits
            <br>Induced him to feed upon Rabbits;
            <br>When he’d eaten eighteen,
            <br>he turned perfectly green,
            <br>Upon which he relinquished those habits.

            <br>There was an old person of Woking,
            <br>Whose mind was perverse and provoking;
            <br>He sate on a rail, with his head in a pail,
            <br>That illusive old person of Woking.

            <br>There was an Old Person of Dutton,
            <br>Whose head was as small as a button;
            <br>So to make it look big he purchased a wig,
            <br>And rapidly rushed about Dutton.
